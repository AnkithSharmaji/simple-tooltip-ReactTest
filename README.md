# simple-tooltip-ReactTest


Created a simple tooltip component such that when I hover over a button it shows me some tooltip

**To Run this code follow the below steps**
 In the terminal, run the following command to create a new React application:
          npx create-react-app my-tooltip-app
Once the command finishes, navigate to the newly created project folder using the terminal:
          cd my-tooltip-app
To run the application, execute the following command in the terminal:
          npm start

This command will start the development server, and your default web browser will automatically open a new tab with http://localhost:3000/. If it doesn't open automatically, you can manually open your browser and navigate to that URL.
